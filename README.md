# My Personal Website

This repository contains the source code for my personal website, which I built with the help of ChatGPT, an AI language model by OpenAI. By interacting with ChatGPT, I was able to learn coding concepts, receive guidance on HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and bring my website to life.

## Overview

The website features a clean and responsive design with a dark/light mode toggle. It includes the following components:

- A homepage with an introduction and a navigation menu
- A blog page with a list of blog posts
- Individual blog post pages with detailed content
- A responsive navigation bar with a dark/light mode toggle button
- Social media links in the footer

Throughout the development process, ChatGPT provided valuable assistance in the form of code examples, design suggestions, and general advice on best practices.
